    "\n",
    "A guide to scripting in KLayout using the Python Library. This guide is inspired by the [PyPi](https://www.klayout.org/klayout-pypi) API. This guide will show you how to generate cells (structures) in KLayout and build nested cells (using a pattern in another pattern).\n",

    "KLayout allows users to build patterns in a database (GDSII) file, which can be read by the Raith Voyager system. Patterns may be placed in nested cells, which is the equivalent of building a position list, but can also be seen individually within the database allowing users to build a position list using the Raith tool.\n",
